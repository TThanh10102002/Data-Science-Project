This Capstone Project was completed as part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate program. It was conducted using the SpaceX dataset provided by IBM. In this repository, I developed a Dashboard using Python and visualized various charts within it. Other tasks, such as data preprocessing, data analysis, and running regression models related to the dataset, were performed directly during the course and are validated through the certificate I obtained.
